# • use 4 spaces (instead of tabs) for indentation
# • limit line length to 78 characters
# • when naming identifiers, use CamelCase for classes
# • lowercase_with_underscores for functons and variables
# • place imports at the top of the file
# • keep function definitions together
# • use docstrings to document functions
# • use two blank lines to separate function definitions from each other
# • keep top level statements, including function calls, together at the bottom of the program

# de Morgans Laws / Simplification Laws :  
# not (x and y) == (not x) or (not y)
# not (x or y) == (not x) and (not y)

# Boolean and operators:

# x and False == False
# False and x == False
# y and x == x and y
# x and True == x
# True and x == x
# x and x == x
#
# Boolean or  operators:
#
# x or False == x
# False or x == x
# y or x == x or y
# x or True == True
# True or x == True
# x or x == x

# Boolean not operators:
#
# not (not x) == x
